# DrugTargets
One-Stop Shop to Evaluate Your Drug Target is a gene research aggregation site that directly takes the user to relevant sources based on their search specifications. This site does not contain unique information. Rather, it contains references to UniProt, OMIM, DepMap, The Human Protein Atlas, cBioPortal, Pharos, IMPC, and Open Targets.

**Major issue is that the CSS does not render for the home page after a search is made - will look into that eventually**
